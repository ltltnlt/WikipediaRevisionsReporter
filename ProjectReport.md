## Markdown Tips

If you are unfamiliar with MarkDown, check out 
[the official documentation](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Note that IntelliJ IDEA has a Markdown preview that you can access in 
the upper-right of the editor. Also, since Markdown documents&mdash;like
source code&mdash;should be human-readable, make sure you keep your lines
short, as you can see I have done in my Markdown files.

## Challenge #1 Complete

I changed the direction class.

## Challenge #2 Incomplete

I do not know how to restrict the format of instant timestamp.

## Challenge #3 Complete

I replaced the loop with string code by using the collection.

## Reflection Question #1: Functional vs OO

I prefer using loop since string concatenation is too long and consists of a lot of functions.
If I can choose, I would never use string concatenation. However, string concatenation is more
convenient in some specific circumstances. Obviously, it is more concise and simple. If there
are some errors or mistakes, they should be easier to be found out. Especially in a big project,
loop may be very complex.
I would like to explore string concatenation more to be a better programmer, but it really made
me uncomfortable in the past. I always needed more time to consider the functions. I hope it can
be better in the future.

## Reflection Question #2: Polymorphism and Dependency Inversion

Actually, I am still confused about both of the two terms. I acknowledge that
Polymorphism can guarantee a class to be securer, and it guarantees the classes
to work individually. I am not sure whether the Dependency Inversion may cause 
the confusion. It would not affect Polymorphism though. It affected me a lot to
double check the classes that using Dependency Inversion.
I am not fond of using interfaces, but it can be used to avoid a lot of troubles. 
In this project, the polymorphism and Dependency Inversion helped each other to 
work better. They made the variables more flexible while the variables would not 
interrupt each other.
